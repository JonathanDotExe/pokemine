# pokemine

A Spigot Plugin that brings Pokémon into the game.

This project stands in no affilation with Nintendo, The Pokémon Company, GameFreak or Cretures, Inc.
This is just a non-profit fan made game. I don't own the rights on any of the used pokémon (but the models and sounds are made by me).

This plugin uses the [Spigot API](https://www.spigotmc.org/) licensed under [GNU GPLv3](https://hub.spigotmc.org/stash/projects/SPIGOT/repos/bukkit/browse/LICENCE.txt).
